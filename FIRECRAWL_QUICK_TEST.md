# Firecrawl MCP Testing Guide - Quick Start

This is a quick reference guide for testing Firecrawl MCP integration with the Responses starter app.

## What You're Testing

Firecrawl MCP adds web scraping capabilities to the AI assistant, allowing it to:
- Extract content from web pages
- Crawl entire websites  
- Perform deep research using intelligent web navigation
- Map website structures

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Firecrawl API key from https://firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys
- [ ] Node.js and npm installed
- [ ] This app running on http://localhost:5000

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Start Firecrawl MCP Server

**Option A - Using the script (Recommended):**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
./start-firecrawl-mcp.sh

# Windows
start-firecrawl-mcp.bat
```

**Option B - Manual start:**
```bash
env HTTP_STREAMABLE_SERVER=true FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_api_key npx -y firecrawl-mcp
```

**Important:** Note the URL shown in the console (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/v2/mcp` or `http://localhost:3001/v2/mcp`)

### Step 2: Configure in the App

1. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
2. Click the **menu icon** (â˜° or three dots) in the top-right corner
3. Click **"MCP Servers"** from the menu
4. Click the **"Add Server"** button
5. Fill in the form:
   - **Server Label:** `Firecrawl`
   - **Server URL:** `http://localhost:3000/v2/mcp` (use the URL from Step 1)
   - **Allowed Tools:** *(leave empty)*
   - **Skip approval:** âœ… ON
   - **Enable server:** âœ… ON
6. Click **"Add Server"** or **"Update Server"**

### Step 3: Enable MCP Tools

1. From the same menu, click **"Tools Settings"**
2. Find the **"MCP"** toggle
3. Turn it **ON** (should show as enabled/green)

### Step 4: Test It!

Go back to the chat and try these prompts:

**Test 1 - Basic Scraping:**
```
Can you scrape https://example.com and tell me what's on the page?
```

**Test 2 - Documentation Scraping:**
```
Scrape https://docs.firecrawl.dev and summarize what Firecrawl does
```

**Test 3 - Website Mapping:**
```
Map all the pages on https://firecrawl.dev
```

**Test 4 - Deep Research:**
```
Do deep research on "web scraping with AI assistants" and give me a summary
```

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly, you should see:
1. The assistant acknowledging it will use the Firecrawl tool
2. Tool execution progress (e.g., "Calling firecrawl_scrape...")
3. Structured content extracted from the website
4. A summary or analysis based on the scraped content

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
- Check if port 3000 is available
- Verify your Firecrawl API key is valid
- Try: `npm install -g firecrawl-mcp`

### Tools Not Available
- Verify MCP toggle is ON in Tools Settings
- Check that Firecrawl server is enabled (green checkmark)
- Confirm the server URL matches the console output

### Connection Errors
- Ensure Firecrawl MCP server is still running
- Check the URL in the browser matches the server URL
- Try restarting the Firecrawl MCP server

### Rate Limits
- Free tier has usage limits
- Check your quota at https://firecrawl.dev/app
- Wait a few minutes if you hit the limit

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Tool Selection
Only want specific tools? Add them to "Allowed Tools":
```
firecrawl_scrape,firecrawl_deep_research
```

### Multiple MCP Servers
You can add multiple MCP servers! Each contributes its tools to the assistant.

### Approval Mode
Turn OFF "Skip approval" if you want to review each tool call before execution.

## Testing Checklist

Use this to verify the integration works:

- [ ] Firecrawl MCP server starts successfully
- [ ] Server appears in MCP Servers list in the app
- [ ] MCP toggle is ON in Tools Settings
- [ ] Assistant can scrape a simple page (example.com)
- [ ] Assistant can extract meaningful content
- [ ] Deep research generates comprehensive results
- [ ] Website mapping discovers multiple pages

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

1. **Your prompt** â†’ Next.js app
2. **App** â†’ OpenAI Responses API with MCP tools list
3. **OpenAI** â†’ Decides to use firecrawl_scrape tool
4. **OpenAI** â†’ Calls your local Firecrawl MCP server
5. **Firecrawl** â†’ Uses your API key to scrape the website
6. **Firecrawl** â†’ Returns structured content
7. **OpenAI** â†’ Processes content and generates response
8. **App** â†’ Displays the final answer to you

## Success Criteria

You've successfully tested Firecrawl MCP when:
âœ… Server starts without errors
âœ… Server appears in the app's MCP Servers list
âœ… Tools are available to the assistant
âœ… Assistant can successfully scrape and analyze web content
âœ… Results are relevant and well-formatted

Happy testing! ðŸš€
